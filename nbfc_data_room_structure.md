## WHY THIS DATA ROOM IS DIFFERENT: REGULATORY OVERLAY

Unlike a typical technology or trading company, every aspect of FinServe Capital's operations is governed by the Reserve Bank of India's regulatory framework for NBFCs. This means that in addition to standard corporate compliance under the Companies Act, the company must:

1. Maintain minimum Net Owned Funds (NOF) of Rs. 2 Crores at all times
2. Follow RBI-prescribed exposure norms (no single borrower can exceed 25% of capital)
3. Maintain Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of minimum 15%
4. Follow Fair Practices Code in lending
5. Submit quarterly, half-yearly and annual returns to RBI
6. Undergo RBI inspections and respond to their observations
7. Comply with KYC and Anti-Money Laundering regulations
8. Follow Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms
9. Not accept public deposits without specific RBI permission
10. Obtain prior RBI approval for significant changes like shareholding, management, or business model

This regulatory framework means the data room contains an extensive additional section on regulatory compliance that would not exist for an unregulated company.

## UNIQUE REGULATORY RED FLAGS TO WATCH

Unlike a tech company where issues might be commercial, regulatory red flags can be fatal:

### Critical Red Flags (Deal Breakers):
❌ CRAR below 15% or declining trend
❌ RBI penalties or adverse inspection findings not addressed
❌ Violation of exposure norms or concentration limits
❌ Non-compliance with asset classification norms (evergreening of loans)
❌ Promoter shareholding below 26% without RBI approval
❌ Key management not meeting "fit and proper" criteria
❌ Unresolved customer complaints or systemic fair practices violations

### Caution Flags (Need Remediation):
⚠️ Rising NPA trend without adequate provisioning
⚠️ ALM mismatches or liquidity stress
⚠️ Overdependence on single funding source
⚠️ Pending RBI inspection observations
⚠️ Geographic or product concentration risk
⚠️ Weak collections infrastructure
⚠️ IT systems not robust or cyber vulnerabilities

### Current Status - FinServe Capital:
✅ CRAR comfortable at 18.2%
✅ All RBI returns filed timely
✅ Last RBI inspection observations substantially addressed
✅ Promoter holding at 51% (compliant)
⚠️ NPA at 9.3% - higher than peer average of 6-7% (Being monitored)
⚠️ Asset concentration in Maharashtra (38%) - Geographic risk
✅ Fair Practices Code compliance strong
✅ No regulatory penalties

## INVESTOR DUE DILIGENCE FOCUS AREAS

For PE investors considering investment in FinServe Capital, the priorities differ from tech due diligence:

**Regulatory Approval Process:**
Any equity investment resulting in shareholding beyond 26% requires prior RBI approval. Timeline: 3-6 months. Due diligence must uncover any factors that could lead to RBI rejection (criminal records of incoming investors, source of funds concerns, etc.)

**Asset Quality Deep Dive:**
- Physical verification of sample loan files
- Independent portfolio quality assessment
- Meeting with top 20 borrowers
- Visits to collection centers
- Assessment of collection systems and recovery mechanisms

**Regulatory Risk Assessment:**
- Legal opinion on compliance status
- Review of RBI correspondence
- Assessment of pending observations
- Evaluation of management's relationship with regulator

**Capital Sustainability:**
- Stress testing of capital under various NPA scenarios
- Assessment of capital needs for growth plans
- Evaluation of access to funding sources
- Rating agency view and outlook

## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM TECH COMPANY DATA ROOM

**1. Regulatory Compliance Section:** Represents 30-40% of data room vs. 5% for tech company

**2. Asset Quality Analysis:** Entire section on loan portfolio, NPAs, provisioning - not applicable to tech

**3. Regulator Relationship:** Correspondence with RBI, inspection reports, approvals needed - tech company has minimal regulatory interaction

**4. Capital Adequacy:** Constant monitoring of CRAR, capital planning critical - tech company only cares about cash runway

**5. Funding Documentation:** Detailed lender agreements, security documents, covenants - tech company usually has simpler cap table

**6. Fair Practices and Customer Protection:** Extensive documentation of consumer protection measures - tech company has standard consumer terms

**7. Transaction Approvals:** Many business decisions need RBI approval - tech company has full operational freedom

**8. Fit and Proper:** Directors and management must meet regulatory standards with background checks - tech company has no such requirement
