The ratings reflect FinServe Capital Limited's adequate capitalization,
experienced management team, and established track record in SME and vehicle
financing. The ratings also factor in the company's diversified funding
profile and comfortable liquidity position.

These strengths are partially offset by higher-than-peer asset quality
metrics, geographic concentration in Maharashtra, and moderate scale of
operations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    OUTLOOK: STABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRISIL believes that FinServe Capital will maintain its adequate capital
position and improve its asset quality metrics over the medium term. The
outlook may be revised to 'Positive' if there is:

- Sustained improvement in asset quality with Gross NPA below 7%
- Significant improvement in profitability with ROA above 2.5%
- Successful equity raise enhancing capital position

Conversely, the outlook may be revised to 'Negative' if:

- Asset quality deteriorates with Gross NPA above 12%
- Profitability remains subdued with ROA below 1.5%
- Capital position weakens with CRAR below 16%
- Liquidity stress emerges due to funding challenges

================================================================================
                    KEY SENSITIVITIES
================================================================================

UPSIDE SCENARIOS:

1. Sustained asset quality improvement with Gross NPA < 7%
2. Successful equity raise of Rs. 80 Crores
3. Improvement in ROA to above 2.5%

DOWNSIDE SCENARIOS:

1. Asset quality deterioration with Gross NPA > 12%
2. Capital erosion with CRAR < 16%
3. Liquidity stress or funding challenges
4. Adverse regulatory action

================================================================================
                    LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS
