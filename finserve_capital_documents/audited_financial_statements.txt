Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of FinServe Capital
Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31,
2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive
Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows
for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the
explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements give the
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ("Act") in the manner so
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the
Company as at March 31, 2024, its profit including other comprehensive
income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)
specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our
responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements and the Code of Ethics.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were
of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current
period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

1. Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Loan Portfolio

   The Company's loan portfolio of Rs. 392 Crores requires significant
   judgment in estimating Expected Credit Losses. The key areas of judgment
   include staging of loans, probability of default, loss given default, and
   macroeconomic variables. We have examined the methodology, tested key
   assumptions, and verified calculations.

2. Asset Classification as per RBI IRACP Norms

   The Company is required to classify loan assets and make provisions as
   per RBI Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning norms.
   We have verified the asset classification, tested ageing of receivables,
   and checked provisioning adequacy.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss, and the Cash Flow
Statement dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the books of account.
