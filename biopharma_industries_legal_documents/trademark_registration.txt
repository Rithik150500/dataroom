SECTION 3: FREEDOM TO OPERATE OPINIONS

================================================================================

BioPharma Industries manufactures generic pharmaceutical formulations. For each
product, the Company has obtained legal opinions confirming freedom to operate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 SAMPLE FREEDOM TO OPERATE OPINION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEGAL OPINION: FREEDOM TO OPERATE
Product: Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets 10mg/20mg/40mg/80mg

Prepared By:        M/s. IP Rights LLP, Patent and Trademark Attorneys
Date:               March 15, 2017
Reference:          IPR/FTO/BIO/2017/ATOR/001

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Based on our review of the patent landscape, we opine that BioPharma Industries
Limited is free to manufacture, market, and sell Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets
in the Indian market and for export to non-regulated markets.

ANALYSIS:

1. ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT (API):

   Original Innovator:    Pfizer Inc. (Brand: Lipitor)
   Original Patent:       US Patent No. 4,681,893 (Compound patent)
   Indian Patent Status:  No compound patent granted in India (pre-2005)
   Expiry in USA:         November 2011
   Status:                API is off-patent globally

2. FORMULATION PATENTS:

   A search of the Indian Patent Office database and global patent databases
   was conducted for formulation patents covering atorvastatin tablets.

   Patents Identified:    12 formulation patents globally
   Patents in India:      3 patents granted

   Analysis of Indian Patents:

   a) IN 234567 - Controlled release formulation of atorvastatin
      Patentee: XYZ Pharma
      Expiry: 2025
      Relevance: NOT RELEVANT - BioPharma's product is immediate release,
      not controlled release. Different formulation approach.

   b) IN 345678 - Combination of atorvastatin with ezetimibe
      Patentee: ABC Labs
      Expiry: 2026
      Relevance: NOT RELEVANT - BioPharma's product is single entity
      atorvastatin, not a combination product.

   c) IN 456789 - Stabilized atorvastatin formulation using specific excipients
      Patentee: PQR Healthcare
      Expiry: 2024
      Relevance: POTENTIALLY RELEVANT - Patent claims specific combination
      of excipients for stability.

      Detailed Analysis: BioPharma's formulation uses different excipients
      and different ratios. Patent claims are limited to specific excipient
      combination. BioPharma's formulation does not infringe the claims.

      CONCLUSION: NO INFRINGEMENT

3. MANUFACTURING PROCESS PATENTS:

   No process patents identified that would restrict manufacture of
   atorvastatin tablets using conventional wet granulation process.

4. CONCLUSION:

   Based on the above analysis, we opine that:

   a) The API atorvastatin calcium is off-patent and freely available.

   b) BioPharma Industries' formulation of Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets
      does not infringe any valid and subsisting patent in India.

   c) BioPharma Industries is free to manufacture, market, and sell
      Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets in India and export markets.

   d) For regulated markets (US, EU), separate patent analysis considering
      local patent laws should be conducted.

LIMITATIONS:

- This opinion is based on patent search conducted as of the date hereof.
- New patents may be granted after this date.
- This opinion covers India only.
- Trademark and regulatory aspects are not covered.
