4.4 CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT

WHO-UMC Causality Assessment System:

Category         Criteria
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certain          - Reasonable temporal relationship
                 - Cannot be explained by disease or other drugs
                 - Plausible pharmacologically
                 - Positive rechallenge

Probable/Likely  - Reasonable temporal relationship
                 - Unlikely to be due to disease or other drugs
                 - Reasonable response to withdrawal

Possible         - Reasonable temporal relationship
                 - Could also be explained by disease or other drugs
                 - Information on withdrawal may be lacking

Unlikely         - Temporal relationship makes causal connection improbable
                 - Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations
