# Legal Data Rooms Across Indian Industry Sectors
## Understanding How Due Diligence Changes by Business Type

## WHY SECTOR MATTERS IN DATA ROOMS

When you compared the SaaS company data room I created earlier to what you would find for a pharmaceutical manufacturer or a real estate developer, you would think you were looking at entirely different creatures. This is not because one company is more legitimate than another, but because different businesses face fundamentally different risks, regulatory frameworks, and value drivers.

Think about it this way: when you invest in a software company, you worry most about intellectual property, customer contracts, and whether the founders will stick around. But when you invest in a manufacturing company, you worry about whether their factory might explode, whether they have permission to pollute the local river within certain limits, whether their workers might strike, and whether their machinery is mortgaged to three different banks. The documents in the data room reflect these different anxieties.

Let me walk you through how data rooms transform across major Indian sectors, and then I'll give you detailed mock examples for the most interesting ones.

## SECTOR-BY-SECTOR OVERVIEW

### MANUFACTURING & INDUSTRIAL

When you open a data room for a manufacturing company, the first thing that hits you is the sheer physicality of everything. Unlike a tech company that could theoretically operate from laptops in a coffee shop, a manufacturer has factories, machinery, raw materials, finished goods inventory, and hundreds or thousands of workers. This physical presence creates layers of compliance and risk that tech companies never touch.

**What Dominates the Data Room:**

The environmental compliance section becomes enormous. You need to see their consent to establish and consent to operate from the State Pollution Control Board, their hazardous waste management authorizations, their water and air emission monitoring reports, and their environmental impact assessments. If they have not been measuring their effluent discharge every month and filing reports with the pollution board, that is a massive red flag because the entire factory could be shut down.

The labor and industrial relations section grows from a few employment contracts into a complex web of documentation. You have standing orders certified under the Industrial Employment Act, the factory license under the Factories Act showing they meet safety standards, records of their compliance with the Contract Labour Act if they use contract workers, wage registers proving they pay minimum wages, and often collective bargaining agreements with unions. Manufacturing companies in India frequently deal with unions, and past strikes or pending labor disputes can be deal-breakers for investors.

The assets and security section becomes critical because manufacturers typically have secured debt. Banks lending to manufacturers want collateral, so you will find that their land, building, and machinery are often mortgaged through hypothecation deeds, registered charges at the Registrar of Companies, and CERSAI registrations. An investor needs to map out exactly which assets are free and clear versus which ones the bank can seize if the company defaults on loans.

Product compliance and quality certifications matter enormously. Depending on what they manufacture, you need to see their Bureau of Indian Standards certifications, ISO quality management system certificates, product testing reports, and compliance with the Legal Metrology Act if they package products. If they export, you need certificates of origin, export licenses, and compliance with international quality standards for their target markets.

**What Investors Worry About:**

The factory could be sitting on contaminated land from decades of industrial use, creating environmental liability. Their machinery might be obsolete and require massive capital expenditure to remain competitive. They might have pending labor disputes that could result in strikes or massive back-pay claims. Their raw material suppliers might have them over a barrel if there are only one or two sources for critical inputs. Their working capital cycle might be a nightmare if they have to pay suppliers in 30 days but customers only pay them in 180 days.

### REAL ESTATE & CONSTRUCTION

Real estate data rooms are where you learn that land ownership in India is a Byzantine nightmare that would make medieval European feudalism look simple. The core anxiety in real estate due diligence is: does this developer actually own the land they claim to own, and do they have permission to build what they are trying to build?

**What Dominates the Data Room:**

The title documents section is the heart of everything. You need the original sale deed showing how the developer acquired the land, traced back through an unbroken chain of title for at least 30 years, ideally back to the government grant. But it gets complicated fast. You need encumbrance certificates from the sub-registrar office proving no one else has a claim on the property. You need land conversion orders if agricultural land was converted to non-agricultural use. You need partition deeds if the land was divided among family members before the developer bought it. You need possession certificates proving the developer actually has physical control of the land, not just paper ownership.

The regulatory approvals section reads like a scavenger hunt through Indian bureaucracy. You need the commencement certificate allowing construction to start, building plan approvals from the municipal corporation, environmental clearances if the project is above a certain size, coastal regulation zone clearances if near the sea, forest clearances if any forest land is involved, fire safety approvals, and the occupation certificate allowing buyers to move in once construction finishes. Missing even one of these can mean the project is illegal and can be demolished.

The buyer agreements section shows what revenue the developer has locked in. You need agreements to sell with each flat buyer, showing how much they have paid versus what they owe, escrow account statements proving buyer money is kept separate and not diverted to other projects, RERA registration certificates for the project under the Real Estate Regulation Act, and quarterly progress reports filed with RERA showing the project is on schedule.

The construction contracts reveal whether the project can actually be completed. You need agreements with contractors, architect agreements, engineer certifications, material supply agreements, and bank guarantees from contractors ensuring they complete their work. Cost overruns in construction are endemic in India, so investors scrutinize whether the budget makes sense.

**What Investors Worry About:**

The title could be defective because someone 50 years ago forged a signature on a sale deed, and now that person's grandchildren are claiming the land. The developer might have diverted buyer money from Project A to fund Project B, which is illegal under RERA and could land the promoters in jail. Construction might stall because the developer ran out of money or the contractor walked off the job. The project might violate setback requirements or floor space index limits, meaning the municipal corporation could order floors demolished. Local politicians might be demanding bribes to process approvals, creating uncertain timelines and costs.

### HEALTHCARE & PHARMACEUTICALS

Pharmaceutical data rooms are unique because the product itself is regulated at every stage from conception to consumption, and the consequences of getting it wrong can be measured in human lives lost, not just money.

**What Dominates the Data Room:**

The drug approvals and licenses section is where you verify the company can legally manufacture and sell its products. You need manufacturing licenses from the state Drug Control Department for each facility, product approvals from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization for each drug formulation, Good Manufacturing Practice certificates showing the facility meets quality standards, stability study data proving the drug remains effective through its shelf life, and bioequivalence study reports for generic drugs proving they work as well as the original branded drug. Each drug license lists exactly which drugs can be made at which facility, so you cannot just assume because they have one license they can make anything they want.

The clinical trials and regulatory filings section becomes massive if the company does any research and development. You need clinical trial approvals from the DCGI, ethics committee approvals showing human testing was done ethically, adverse event reports documenting any patient harm during trials, chemistry and manufacturing controls documents describing exactly how the drug is made, patent filings and grants for novel molecules, and patent challenge documentation if they are trying to make generics of patented drugs.

The pharmacovigilance and product liability section tracks what happens after drugs reach patients. You need adverse event monitoring reports, product recall records if any batches had quality issues, legal notices and lawsuits from patients claiming harm, insurance coverage for product liability claims, and agreements with contract research organizations doing safety monitoring.

The intellectual property section is far more detailed than for most industries because patents are literally the business. You need patent prosecution files showing the back and forth with the patent office, freedom to operate opinions from lawyers saying their drug does not infringe anyone else's patents, patent opposition proceedings where competitors try to invalidate their patents, licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, and Paragraph IV certifications for generic drugs notifying patent holders of challenges.

**What Investors Worry About:**

A drug could fail in late-stage clinical trials after hundreds of crores have been invested, wiping out the company's value overnight. The patent on a blockbuster drug could be invalidated by a competitor's challenge, opening the market to generic competition and destroying profit margins. Manufacturing could be found to violate GMP standards, resulting in a facility shutdown and product recalls. Side effects could emerge after market approval, leading to withdrawal of the drug and massive liability claims. Regulatory approval timelines are unpredictable, so a drug expected to launch in 2026 might not get approved until 2028, throwing off all financial projections.

### NON-BANKING FINANCIAL COMPANIES (NBFCs)

NBFC data rooms are about one thing above all else: can this company collect the money it has lent out, and is it being run in a way that will not make the Reserve Bank of India shut it down?

**What Dominates the Data Room:**

The RBI licensing and compliance section is the foundation. You need the certificate of registration from RBI to operate as an NBFC, classification letters showing whether they are NBFC-D (deposit-taking) or NBFC-ND (non-deposit taking), prudential norm compliance reports showing they are following RBI's rules on capital adequacy, annual returns filed with RBI, inspection reports from RBI examiners if RBI has conducted an inspection, and correspondence with RBI about any violations or concerns.

The loan portfolio section is where the real value and risk lie. You need detailed loan-level data for a sample of loans showing borrower details, loan amounts, interest rates, security taken, repayment status, a breakdown of the entire loan portfolio by product type, geography, ticket size, vintage, the non-performing asset schedule showing which loans have defaulted, provisioning schedules showing how much money they have set aside for expected losses, write-off policies and actual write-offs, and recovery rates on defaulted loans.

The security documentation is crucial because Indian NBFCs typically lend on a secured basis. You need mortgage deeds for property-backed loans, CERSAI registrations proving their security interest is recorded, vehicle hypothecation documents for auto loans, personal guarantees from borrowers and directors, copies of gold loan pledge agreements if they run a gold loan business, and valuation reports for the assets taken as security.

The funding and liability structure shows how the NBFC gets the money it then lends out. You need loan agreements with banks that lend to the NBFC, debenture trust deeds if they have issued bonds, commercial paper issuance documents, assignment agreements if they sell loan portfolios to other institutions, external credit ratings from CRISIL, CARE, or other rating agencies, and compliance with borrowing limits set by RBI.

**What Investors Worry About:**

The asset quality could be far worse than reported because borrowers are being shown as current when they are actually in default. Fraud is endemic in Indian lending, with borrowers submitting fake income documents, property valuations being inflated, or company employees colluding with borrowers. The NBFC might not have perfected their security interests properly, so they cannot actually seize the mortgaged property if borrowers default. They might be violating RBI norms on concentration limits by having too much exposure to one sector or geography. Their cost of funds might be rising while they are stuck with old loans at low interest rates, crushing margins. A slowdown in the economy could cause defaults to spike, wiping out their capital.

### E-COMMERCE & ONLINE RETAIL

E-commerce data rooms reflect a business model that regulators have not fully figured out how to categorize, creating ambiguity and risk around what is actually permitted.

**What Dominates the Data Room:**

The marketplace structure and FDI compliance section addresses the elephant in the room: foreign investment in B2C e-commerce is banned in India, so foreign-funded companies use a marketplace model where they claim to just connect buyers and sellers rather than sell inventory themselves. You need the detailed explanation of the marketplace model, legal opinions saying the structure complies with FDI rules, vendor agreements with all sellers on the platform, data showing the company does not own more than 25% of the inventory sold through any single vendor, pricing independence documentation showing vendors set their own prices, and related party transaction disclosures if founders or affiliates are also vendors on the platform.

The logistics and fulfillment section covers how products actually reach customers. You need warehouse lease agreements for fulfillment centers across India, agreements with delivery companies like Delhivery or BlueDart, technology services agreements with third-party sellers to provide cataloging or photography services, return and refund policies showing how failed transactions are handled, and insurance coverage for goods in transit and in warehouses.

The consumer protection and e-commerce rules compliance section has grown massively since new regulations came into force. You need evidence of mandatory information disclosures on the website, grievance redressal mechanism documentation showing there is an officer who handles complaints, consumer complaint records and resolutions, compliance with pricing display requirements, country of origin display for all products, and systems to prevent the sale of prohibited items like prescription drugs without prescription.

The payment processing and escrow section shows how money flows through the system. You need agreements with payment gateways like Razorpay or PayU, PCI DSS compliance certificates for payment card security, escrow account agreements with banks where customer payments are held before being disbursed to sellers, reconciliation reports showing payments match orders, and compliance with the Payment and Settlement Systems Act.

**What Investors Worry About:**

The entire marketplace structure could be deemed a sham by regulators who decide the company is actually doing inventory-led e-commerce, which would require divesting foreign investors or shutting down. Key vendors might actually be controlled by the company through back-door arrangements, violating FDI rules. The company might be offering deep discounts that constitute predatory pricing aimed at killing competitors. They might be strong-arming sellers to give exclusive launches or better prices than those sellers give competitors, which may violate competition law. Data breaches could expose millions of customer credit card details. Cash burn could be unsustainable as they fight for market share.

## THE COMMON THREAD

Despite all these differences, every data room ultimately tries to answer the same fundamental questions: Does this company exist legally and is it structured properly? Does it have the permissions needed to operate? Does it own or properly license the assets it needs? Are its contracts with customers, suppliers, and employees enforceable? Is it paying its taxes? Does it have any hidden liabilities waiting to explode? Will the founders stay? Can the business model actually generate returns?

The sectors differ in which of these questions dominates and how complex the answer becomes. A tech company can make do with basic incorporation documents and customer contracts. A pharmaceutical manufacturer needs approvals from a dozen different regulators and five different types of insurance to sleep at night. But the underlying logic of due diligence remains constant: trust but verify, assume nothing, and understand that if a document is missing from the data room, there is usually a reason why.

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

When you approach any data room, your first question should be: what are the three things that could destroy this company's value overnight? For manufacturing, it is environmental violations, labor strikes, or loss of key customer contracts. For real estate, it is defective title, lack of regulatory approvals, or inability to complete construction. For pharma, it is drug approval failure, patent invalidation, or manufacturing shutdowns. For NBFCs, it is asset quality deterioration, RBI violations, or funding source drying up. For e-commerce, it is regulatory challenge to the business model, data breach, or unsustainable burn rate.

Once you identify those existential risks, you dive deep into the sections of the data room that address them. You do not give equal attention to every folder. You apply professional skepticism: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. If key documents are missing, you ask why. If dates do not line up across different documents, you investigate. If the company is in a highly regulated sector but the compliance section is thin, you worry.

Due diligence is not about reading every page of every document. It is about understanding the business well enough to know what matters, having the domain knowledge to spot red flags, and having the professional judgment to distinguish between immaterial historical issues and material ongoing problems. The data room is your window into the company's legal and operational soul, but you need to know what you are looking at to see clearly.
