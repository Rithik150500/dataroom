SKYLINE DEVELOPERS PRIVATE LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

OPINION

We have audited the financial statements of SKYLINE DEVELOPERS PRIVATE LIMITED
("the Company"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2024, and
the Statement of Profit and Loss and Cash Flow Statement for the year then
ended, and notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view
of the financial position of the Company as at 31st March, 2024, and its
financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India.

BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)
specified under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities
section. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

KEY AUDIT MATTERS

1. REVENUE RECOGNITION (Ind AS 115)
   Revenue from real estate projects is recognized using the percentage of
   completion method based on project costs incurred. This involves significant
   judgment in estimating total project costs and stage of completion.

2. INVENTORY VALUATION
   Work-in-progress and completed units are valued at lower of cost and net
   realizable value. Estimation of NRV requires judgment on expected selling
   prices.

EMPHASIS OF MATTER

We draw attention to Note 25 regarding the extension of project timelines for
Skyline Residency and Skyline Commercial Hub due to regulatory approvals. This
does not modify our opinion.
