                    CONVERSION ILLUSTRATION

EXAMPLE 1: Qualified Financing at Rs. 75 Cr pre-money valuation

Principal + Interest (after 12 months): Rs. 54,00,000

Option A - Discount Method:
- Price in financing: Rs. 75 Cr / 28,750 FD shares = Rs. 26,087 per share
- Discounted price: Rs. 26,087 x 0.80 = Rs. 20,870 per share
- Shares issued: Rs. 54,00,000 / Rs. 20,870 = 259 shares

Option B - Valuation Cap Method:
- Cap price: Rs. 15 Cr / 28,750 FD shares = Rs. 5,217 per share
- Shares issued: Rs. 54,00,000 / Rs. 5,217 = 1,035 shares

Investor receives: 1,035 shares (better of the two)
