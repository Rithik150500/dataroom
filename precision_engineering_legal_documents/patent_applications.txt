Expiry Date            : 14th June, 2039

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inventors:
1. Vikram Rajan (Managing Director)
2. Anand Kumar (Whole-time Director)
3. R. Krishnamurthy (Senior Manufacturing Engineer)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Field:

The invention relates to an automated system for aligning workpieces in CNC
machining centers, and more particularly to a vision-based system that
automatically detects workpiece position and orientation and adjusts the machine
coordinates for precise machining.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:

An automated workpiece alignment system for CNC machining centers comprising a
vision sensor unit, a processing unit, and a coordinate adjustment module. The
vision sensor captures images of the workpiece mounted on the machine table.
The processing unit analyzes the images to determine the exact position and
orientation of the workpiece relative to the reference datum. The coordinate
adjustment module automatically updates the machine coordinate system to
compensate for any misalignment, ensuring accurate machining without manual
intervention. The system reduces setup time by 40% and improves first-article
inspection pass rate to 98%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Claims (Summary):

Claim 1: An automated workpiece alignment system comprising...
Claim 2: The system of claim 1, wherein the vision sensor includes...
Claim 3: The system of claim 1, further comprising a calibration module...

changes in multi-axis CNC machining centers without compromising on accuracy
and repeatability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:

A modular quick-change tooling system for multi-axis CNC machining centers
comprising a standardized tool holder interface, precision locating mechanism,
and automatic clamping system. The system enables tool changes in under 10
seconds while maintaining positional accuracy of 2 microns. The modular design
allows different tool types to be used with the same holder, reducing tooling
inventory costs by 40%.
