Dear Sir,

Subject: Action Taken Report on RBI On-Site Inspection Observations

We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 15, 2023 containing observations from the on-site inspection conducted with reference to our position as on March 31, 2023.

The Board of Directors of the Company met on September 15, 2023 to review all the observations raised by the Reserve Bank of India. The Board has taken serious note of the observations and has directed the management to implement immediate corrective measures.

We submit below our detailed Action Taken Report addressing each observation:

---

OBSERVATION 1: ASSET CLASSIFICATION - EVERGREENING CONCERNS

ACTION TAKEN:

The Board acknowledges the seriousness of this observation and deeply regrets the classification errors. We wish to clarify that these instances occurred due to inadequate system-level controls and not due to any deliberate intent to misrepresent asset quality. Nonetheless, we have taken immediate and comprehensive corrective action as detailed below.

(a) Reclassification and Provisioning: All 8 identified accounts aggregating Rs. 4.2 Crores have been immediately reclassified as Non-Performing Assets with effect from the date of grant of the additional facility. Standard provisioning as per RBI norms has been made as follows:
    - Sub-Standard Assets (4 accounts): Rs. 63 lakhs provisioned at 15%
    - Doubtful Assets - Category D1 (3 accounts): Rs. 84 lakhs provisioned at 25%  
    - Doubtful Assets - Category D2 (1 account): Rs. 40 lakhs provisioned at 40%
    Total Additional Provision: Rs. 1.87 Crores

(b) Portfolio Review: An independent review of the entire loan portfolio for the last 2 financial years (FY 2021-22 and FY 2022-23) has been conducted by our internal audit team under supervision of the external auditors. This review identified 3 additional cases (aggregating Rs. 1.8 Crores) where similar concerns existed. These have also been reclassified as NPA and appropriate provisions of Rs. 48 lakhs have been made.

(c) System-Level Controls: We have implemented the following system controls in our core lending platform:
    - Automatic red-flag alert when any fresh sanction is proposed for a borrower with any overdue amount (even Day 1 overdue)
    - Mandatory approval from Credit Risk Committee for any additional facility to customers with overdues beyond 30 days
    - System restriction preventing disbursement of fresh loans if any adjustment to overdue interest is proposed
    - Monthly MIS report to MD and CRO listing all fresh sanctions to borrowers with any overdue history in preceding 120 days

(d) Credit Risk Framework Enhancement: The Board has approved revised Credit Risk Management Policy incorporating the following:
    - Clear prohibition on "evergreening" practices with illustrative examples
    - Strengthened delegation of powers requiring two-level approval for exceptions
    - Mandatory training for all credit staff on asset classification norms (completed for all staff on August 30, 2023)
    - Quarterly certificate from Head of Credit to Board confirming no evergreening practices

(e) Auditor Certificate: We enclose Certificate dated September 20, 2023 from our Statutory Auditors M/s. ABC & Associates confirming the reclassification of 11 accounts (8 + 3 additional) aggregating Rs. 6.0 Crores and provisioning of Rs. 2.35 Crores.

IMPACT ON FINANCIALS:
- Revised Gross NPA as on March 31, 2023: 11.2% (previously reported: 9.3%)
- Revised Net NPA as on March 31, 2023: 6.4% (previously reported: 5.1%)
- Impact on Profit After Tax: Reduction of Rs. 2.35 Crores (revised PAT: Rs. 13.87 Crores vs. reported Rs. 16.22 Crores)

The revised financial position has been disclosed to all lenders and rating agencies. Our rating agency CRISIL has reaffirmed the rating at A- / Stable after considering the revised financials, noting the proactive corrective action taken.

STATUS: FULLY COMPLIED

OBSERVATION 2: CAPITAL ADEQUACY - TIER II CAPITAL COMPUTATION

ACTION TAKEN:

The Board accepts that the subordinated debt of Rs. 5 Crores raised from Connect Finance Pvt Ltd (where two of our directors hold interests) should not have been included in Tier II Capital without express RBI approval for related party capital.

(a) Exclusion from Tier II: Rs. 5 Crores has been immediately excluded from Tier II Capital computation. The revised CRAR computations are as follows:

Position as on March 31, 2023 (Restated):
- Tier I Capital: Rs. 131 Crores
- Tier II Capital: Rs. 15 Crores (reduced from Rs. 20 Crores)
- Total Capital: Rs. 146 Crores
- Risk Weighted Assets: Rs. 819 Crores
- CRAR: 17.8% (Tier I: 16.0%, Tier II: 1.8%)

While the CRAR remains comfortable above the minimum 15% requirement, we acknowledge the material misstatement in our original computation.

(b) Revised Returns: We have recomputed CRAR for Q4 FY 2022-23, Q1 FY 2023-24, Q2 FY 2023-24, and Q3 FY 2023-24 and filed revised NBS-8 Returns with the Reserve Bank. The restated CRAR for these quarters ranges from 17.8% to 18.5%, all comfortably above the minimum requirement.

(c) Board Policy on Capital from Related Parties: The Board has approved a comprehensive policy on "Capital Raising from Related Parties" which mandates:
    - Any capital raised from parties where directors or key management hold more than 10% interest shall not be treated as regulatory capital unless prior RBI approval is obtained
    - All capital-raising proposals must be accompanied by a declaration on related party status
    - Compliance Officer to certify that proposed capital qualifies as regulatory capital before finalization
    - Annual declaration from all potential capital providers on their relationship with the company and its directors

(d) Future Compliance: Going forward, we will seek prior clarification from RBI before including any capital from connected parties in our regulatory capital computation.

CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR THE Rs. 5 CRORES:
We have repaid Rs. 5 Crores to Connect Finance Pvt Ltd on August 31, 2023 and have raised fresh subordinated debt of Rs. 5 Crores from HDFC Bank Ltd (an unrelated party) on September 10, 2023, which now qualifies as Tier II Capital. Documentation enclosed.

OBSERVATION 3: EXPOSURE NORMS - DOCUMENTATION GAPS

ACTION TAKEN:

(a) Comprehensive Relationship Review: We have conducted a detailed review of all borrowers to identify connected parties using the following parameters:
    - Common promoters/directors (through MCA searches)
    - Cross-guarantees or pledges
    - Common registered addresses
    - Interlocking investments
    - Common management or key personnel
    - Financial interdependence (evidenced by fund flows)

This review covered our entire loan book of 2,847 borrowers. We identified 37 cases of connected borrowers which have now been classified into 14 distinct borrower groups.

(b) Documentation: For each identified group, we have prepared detailed documentation including:
    - MCA filings showing common directors/shareholders
    - Copies of cross-guarantees/pledges
    - Fund flow analysis establishing financial interconnection
    - Legal opinion on whether entities constitute a "group" for exposure norm purposes

For the specific case of Mehta Industries group mentioned in the observation (Rs. 38 Crores exposure), we have now documented that all three entities (Mehta Industries Pvt Ltd, Mehta Trading Co Pvt Ltd, and Mehta Logistics Ltd) have:
    - Common promoter Mr. Rajesh Mehta holding 75%, 82%, and 68% respectively
    - Registered at the same office address
    - Cross-guarantees provided by Mr. Rajesh Mehta for all three entities
    - Significant inter-company transactions evidenced by their financial statements

(c) System Enhancement: We have created a "Connected Parties Register" in our lending system where all identified relationships are recorded. The system now automatically flags any new loan application from an entity connected to an existing borrower.

(d) Credit Approval Process: The credit approval format has been revised to include a mandatory section on "Connected Parties and Group Exposure" which must be completed before any credit approval. Any exposure that takes the combined group exposure beyond 30% of NOF requires approval from the full Board.

(e) Exposure Monitoring: We have implemented monthly monitoring of top 20 single borrower exposures and top 20 group exposures, which is now reported to the Risk Management Committee.

CURRENT COMPLIANCE STATUS:
After regrouping connected entities, our exposure norms compliance is as follows:
- Largest single exposure: Rs. 32 Crores (22.5% of NOF of Rs. 142 Crores) - Within limit of 25%
- Largest group exposure: Rs. 38 Crores (26.8% of NOF) - Within limit of 40%
- All other exposures well within prescribed limits

Documentation report and legal opinion enclosed.

OBSERVATION 5: FAIR PRACTICES CODE - INTEREST RATE COMMUNICATION

ACTION TAKEN:

(a) Revised Loan Documentation: We have completely revised our loan agreement format for vehicle finance (and all other products) to include clear disclosure of:
    - Stated interest rate (e.g., 12% per annum reducing balance)
    - Processing fees (e.g., 2% of loan amount)
    - Any other upfront charges
    - Effective Interest Rate (EIR) or Annual Percentage Rate (APR) that captures the true cost of credit
    - Worked example showing the calculation of EIR

For example, for a loan of Rs. 5 lakhs at 12% interest with 2% processing fee (Rs. 10,000), the EIR is disclosed as 13.2% (approximately).

(b) Amortization Schedule: All loan agreements now include a detailed amortization schedule showing:
    - EMI number (Month 1 to Month 60)
    - Opening Principal Outstanding
    - EMI Amount
    - Interest Component
    - Principal Component
    - Closing Principal Outstanding

This gives complete transparency to customers on how their EMI is allocated between principal and interest over the loan tenure.

(c) Marketing Material Review: All marketing brochures, website content, and advertisements have been reviewed and updated to reflect effective interest rates. Where space constraints prevent showing calculations, we now include a footnote directing customers to visit our branch or website for full cost disclosure.

(d) Sales Staff Training: Training programs have been conducted for all sales and customer-facing staff (completed on August 25-28, 2023) on:
    - Fair Practices Code requirements
    - Transparent communication of charges
    - Prohibition on misleading advertisements
    - Handling customer queries on pricing
    - Grievance redressal mechanism

(e) Customer Communication: For all existing customers (loans originated before the documentation change), we have sent a letter explaining the effective interest rate on their loans and providing the detailed amortization schedule. This exercise was completed for all customers as of September 1, 2023.

Sample revised loan documents and marketing materials enclosed for your review.

BASE CASE (Current interest rate environment):
- Average lending rate: 14.5% per annum
- Average borrowing cost: 9.2% per annum
- Spread: 5.3%
- Net Interest Margin: 7.2%

SCENARIO 1: Interest rates increase by 100 basis points
- Lending rate remains 14.5% (portfolio is 75% fixed-rate)
- Borrowing cost increases to 9.6% (40% of borrowings are floating)
- Spread narrows to 4.9%
- NIM declines to 6.9%
- Impact on PAT: Reduction of Rs. 1.2 Crores (7%)

SCENARIO 2: Interest rates increase by 200 basis points

   - Increased frequency of Audit Committee meetings from quarterly to once every two months
   - Independent Directors to conduct annual self-assessment of compliance with RBI norms
   - External consultant to conduct mock RBI inspection annually to identify gaps proactively

3. Culture of Compliance:
   - Conducted organization-wide training on regulatory compliance and business ethics
   - Incorporated compliance metrics in performance appraisal of all staff
   - Instituted "Compliance Champion" awards to recognize exemplary compliance behavior

4. Technology Investments:
   - Allocated Rs. 50 lakhs for upgrading core lending system with enhanced controls
   - Implementing AI-based transaction monitoring for early detection of potential violations
   - Developing comprehensive MIS dashboard for real-time monitoring of all regulatory parameters

CONCLUSION:

We hope this detailed Action Taken Report addresses all the concerns raised by the Reserve Bank of India. We once again regret the lapses identified and assure the Reserve Bank that we have taken this matter with utmost seriousness.

We have implemented immediate corrective measures and have put in place robust systems and processes to prevent recurrence. We remain committed to operating in full compliance with all RBI regulations and maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and consumer protection.

We request the Reserve Bank to review our Action Taken Report and consider the observations as substantially addressed. We are available for any clarifications or further information that may be required.

We also request the Reserve Bank to conduct a follow-up inspection at a mutually convenient time to verify the implementation of corrective actions.

Thanking you and assuring you of our best services always.

For and on behalf of the Board of Directors
