4.1 AUTOMATIC CONVERSION UPON EQUITY FINANCING

    (a) Upon closing of an Equity Financing prior to Maturity Date, the

    (b) The Conversion Price shall be the lower of:
        (i)  Valuation Cap divided by the Fully Diluted Capitalization, or
        (ii) Price per share in Equity Financing less Discount Rate.

    Example Calculation:

    If Pre-Series A at ₹25 Crore pre-money valuation:
    - Valuation Cap Price = ₹12 Cr / 15,00,000 shares = ₹8.00
    - Discounted Price = ₹25 / (1 - 0.20) = ₹20.00
    - Conversion Price = ₹8.00 (lower of two)

4.2 OPTIONAL CONVERSION

    At any time prior to Maturity Date, the Investor may elect to convert
    the Note into Equity Shares at a price based on the Valuation Cap.

4.3 CONVERSION UPON MATURITY

    (a) If no Equity Financing has occurred by Maturity Date, the Investors
        may by Majority consent:
        (i)  Extend the Maturity Date by up to 12 months, or
        (ii) Convert into Equity Shares at Valuation Cap, or
        (iii) Demand repayment.

4.4 CONVERSION UPON CORPORATE TRANSACTION

    If a Change of Control occurs prior to conversion:
    - Option 1: Receive 2x Principal Amount, or
    - Option 2: Convert at Valuation Cap and participate in transaction
